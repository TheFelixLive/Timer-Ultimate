## About
Timer Ultimate is basically tool to track your time in your Minecraft World. However when you play Minecraft, you also play differently depending on your game mode.
That's why there are different timers: one for [survival](#survival-mode) and one for [creative](#creative-mode).

> [!TIP]
>  To control the timer, you can use different functions which are in this syntax: `/function timer/[...]`
>  or you use the **recommended menu**, which will open with `/function timer/menu`.
>  Make shure you have the right **[permission](#Permissions)**!



## Creative Mode
The creative mode is kind of a lightweight mode if you compare them. It's designed to allow multiple timers to be tracked simultaneously.
What do I mean by that? Player 1 can have a different time than Player 2. In fact, someone can pause their timer while another person's timer continues counting.
So much for the theory, let's talk about the home screen:

There we have the following Buttons:

<details><summary>Mode</summary>

This button allows you to **pause** or **resume** the timer, as well as **hide it** completely from the action bar.
>  If you are using global mode, pause and resume will also be applied to other players.

</details>

<details><summary>Addon</summary>

Here you can togelle some Modification on or off. It's a kind of mod menu, but again nothing compared to the other one.
| Fullbright | Custom Music  | AFK |

</details> 

<details><summary>Reset</summary>

As the title suggests it sets the timer to 0, which also can be used in global mode.
