Timer V is the fourth attempt at rewriting the timer. This time, it's based on JavaScript, which already allows for a significant degree of customization in the menus and the timer itself.
When you know what are you doing you can test the current build but I am planning to release a test version soon to the public.
But for now here is a **list** of fetures for the new maior update for the Timer. [Let me know what](https://github.com/TheFelixLive/Timer-Ultimate/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) you think about it!

# New fetures
- **Daytime** - Adds optional for all players a clock of the gametime or real time
- **Designs** - Let every players choose their look for the actionbar between templates!
- **Permissions** - Can now be changed via the menu and regardless of whether the player is online
- **Performance** - Requires less power and survival as well as creative mode are no longer separated

# Current progress

- [X] Creative Mode _(since 7.5.25)_
- [X] Survival Mode - initial setup _(since 10.5.25)_
- [ ] Survival Mode - Survival
- [ ] Survival Mode - Endings
