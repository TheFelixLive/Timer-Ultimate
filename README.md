## About
Timer Ultimate is basically tool to track your time in your Minecraft World. However when you play Minecraft, you also play differently depending on your game mode.
That's why there are different timers: one for [survival](#survival-mode) and one for [creative](#creative-mode).

> [!TIP]
>  To control the timer, you can use different functions which are in this syntax: `/function timer/[...]`
>  or you use the **recommended menu**, which will open with `/function timer/menu`



## Creative Mode
The creative mode is kind of a lightweight mode if you compare them. It's designed to allow multiple timers to be tracked simultaneously.
What do I mean by that? Player 1 can have a different time than Player 2. In fact, someone can pause their timer while another person's timer continues counting.

## Survival Mode
